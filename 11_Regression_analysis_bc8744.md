# 4. Regression analysis

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to study the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. By establishing a mathematical model, regression analysis aims to reveal how changes in independent variables affect changes in dependent variables, as well as the extent and direction of this influence.
Regression analysis can be divided into two categories:
• Simple linear regression: regression analysis when there is only one independent variable. The regression equation is Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + ε.
• Multiple linear regression: regression analysis when there are multiple independent variables. The regression equation is Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + ε.
