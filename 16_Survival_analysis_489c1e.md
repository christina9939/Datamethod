# 9. Survival analysis

Survival analysis is a statistical method used to study the probability and time relationship of a specific event (such as death, disease recurrence, equipment failure, etc.) occurring in an individual or object over a period of time. It takes into account the censoring situation in the data, that is, the observed survival time may not reach the endpoint event or be lost.
The main contents of survival analysis include:
• Survival Function: Describes the probability of an individual or object surviving within a given time.
• Survival Curve: A curve drawn with time as the horizontal axis and survival function as the vertical axis, which is used to intuitively display the survival probability of individuals or objects at different time points.
• Censoring: Some observations in the survival data may be censored because they did not reach the endpoint event. Survival analysis should consider how to deal with such censored data.
• Hazard Ratio: It is used to compare the risk differences in survival time between different groups or treatments and is an important indicator of survival analysis.
• Cumulative Hazard: It describes the cumulative probability of experiencing an endpoint event before a given time point.
• Survival analysis model: It includes semi-parametric models (such as Cox proportional hazard model) and parametric models (such as exponential distribution, Weibull distribution, etc.), which are used to estimate the survival function and compare the impact of different factors on survival time.
Survival analysis is widely used in medicine, biology, epidemiology, engineering and other fields to evaluate treatment effects, disease prognosis, product life, quality control and other issues.
