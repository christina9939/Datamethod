# 8. Spatial Data Analysis

Spatial data analysis is a method that focuses on processing and analyzing data related to geographic locations. This type of data includes geographic information, geographic coordinates, topography, etc., and is usually based on spatial objects and their locations on the earth's surface. The goal of spatial data analysis is to reveal patterns, trends, and associations in geographic space, thereby helping us better understand geographic phenomena, make decisions, and plan.
The main contents of spatial data analysis include:
• Geographic Information System (GIS): GIS is a tool that integrates spatial data analysis and spatial data visualization. It allows users to collect, store, analyze, and display geospatial data, supporting map making and decision making.
• Geostatistics: Geostatistics focuses on statistical analysis of phenomena in geographic space, including spatial interpolation and variogram analysis.
• Geographic Data Mining: Similar to traditional data mining, geographic data mining focuses on discovering hidden patterns and knowledge from spatial data.
• Spatial model: Use statistical and machine learning methods to establish prediction and classification models for spatial data, such as spatial regression models, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), etc.
• Network analysis: Study the paths, connections and network relationships in spatial networks, which are usually used in transportation planning, telecommunications networks and other fields.
• Remote sensing analysis: Use remote sensing technology to obtain information on the earth's surface, and analyze remote sensing images to understand surface characteristics, coverage types and changes.
