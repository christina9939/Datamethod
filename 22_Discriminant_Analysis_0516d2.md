# 15. Discriminant Analysis

Discriminant Analysis is a statistical analysis method that aims to distinguish or classify the differences between two or more known groups. Its main purpose is to determine the relationship between multiple variables (also called predictor variables) and one or more categorical variables (also called response variables or dependent variables) by analyzing these variables and making classifications or predictions based on these relationships.
Discriminant analysis is often used in the following situations:
• The data contains one or more continuous variables, as well as a discrete categorical variable.
• Predict unknown categorical labels from known variables.
• Distinguish between two or more groups and determine which variables are most effective in distinguishing these groups.
The main goal of discriminant analysis is to find one or more linear combinations of functions that can best distinguish the differences between different groups. In practice, discriminant analysis usually produces a discriminant function that can be used to classify new observations to determine which group they belong to.
There are several different types of discriminant analysis, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and other variants. The choice of these methods depends on the nature of the data, the degree to which the assumptions are met, and the specific purpose of the analysis.
