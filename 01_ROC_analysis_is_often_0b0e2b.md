# ROC analysis is often used to compare the performance of different models, select the best classifier, optimize the model threshold, etc. It has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis, credit scoring, advertising click prediction and other fields.

15. Discriminant Analysis
Discriminant Analysis is a statistical analysis method that aims to distinguish or classify the differences between two or more known groups. Its main purpose is to determine the relationship between multiple variables (also called predictor variables) and one or more categorical variables (also called response variables or dependent variables) by analyzing these variables and making classifications or predictions based on these relationships.
Discriminant analysis is often used in the following situations:
• The data contains one or more continuous variables, as well as a discrete categorical variable.
• Predict unknown categorical labels from known variables.
• Distinguish between two or more groups and determine which variables are most effective in distinguishing these groups.
The main goal of discriminant analysis is to find one or more linear combinations of functions that can best distinguish the differences between different groups. In practice, discriminant analysis usually produces a discriminant function that can be used to classify new observations to determine which group they belong to.
There are several different types of discriminant analysis, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and other variants. The choice of these methods depends on the nature of the data, the degree to which the assumptions are met, and the specific purpose of the analysis.
16. Contingency Table Analysis
Contingency Table Analysis is a statistical method used to study the relationship between two or more categorical variables. It organizes data into a two-dimensional table, called a contingency table or cross table, where rows represent the levels of one categorical variable and columns represent the levels of another categorical variable. Each cell in the contingency table represents the frequency or percentage of two categorical variables at a specific level combination.
The main purpose of contingency table analysis is to explore and describe the correlation or association between two or more categorical variables. It can help us answer questions such as:
• Is there an association or correlation between two categorical variables?
• What is the degree of association between different levels of categorical variables?
• What is the effect of the level of one categorical variable on the level of another categorical variable?
In contingency table analysis, commonly used statistical methods include the Chi-square test, which is used to test whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables; residual analysis, which is used to determine the degree of difference between the observed frequency and the expected frequency of each cell in the contingency table; and effect size indicators in the contingency table, such as Cramer's V, which are used to describe the strength of the association between two categorical variables.
Contingency table analysis is often used in social sciences, medicine, market research and other fields to help researchers understand and explain the relationship between different categorical variables, so as to conduct more in-depth data interpretation and decision making.
17. Correspondence Analysis
Correspondence Analysis is a multivariate statistical technique used to explore the relationship between categorical data. It is mainly used to analyze the frequency distribution or mutual correlation between two or more categorical variables. The main goal of correspondence analysis is to show the relationship between categorical variables on a two-dimensional graph for easy visualization and interpretation.
The general steps of correspondence analysis include:
• Construct a frequency table: First, construct a frequency table based on the object or problem of the study to record the frequency or proportion of different categorical variables.
• Calculate expected frequency: Calculate expected frequency according to frequency table, that is, the expected frequency of each cell under the assumption that each categorical variable is independent.
• Calculate residual: Compare observed frequency with expected frequency and calculate residual to measure the deviation between observed frequency and expected frequency.
• Perform correspondence analysis: Through mathematical methods such as singular value decomposition of residual, multidimensional data is mapped to low-dimensional space to obtain the relationship between categorical variables.
The results of correspondence analysis are usually presented in the form of correspondence plot, in which the levels or categories of different categorical variables are represented by points on a two-dimensional plane, and the position and relative position of the points reflect the relationship between them.
Correspondence analysis has a wide range of applications in market research, social science surveys, ecology, biostatistics and other fields. It can help researchers discover the correlation between variables, identify patterns and structures in data, and provide useful references for subsequent analysis and interpretation.
