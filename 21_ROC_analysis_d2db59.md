# 14. ROC analysis

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis is a method for evaluating the performance of classification models. It shows the relationship between the true positive rate (also known as sensitivity) and the false positive rate (False Positive Rate) of the classifier by drawing the ROC curve. The horizontal axis of the ROC curve is the false positive rate (FPR), and the vertical axis is the true positive rate (TPR). The curves drawn at different thresholds can help us understand the performance of the classifier under different conditions.
In the ROC curve, we want the true positive rate to be as high as possible and the false positive rate to be as low as possible. Therefore, the closer the ROC curve is to the upper left corner (0,1), the better the classifier performance is. The diagonal line (45Â° straight line) represents the performance level of random guessing.
In addition to drawing the ROC curve, we can also use the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) indicator to measure the performance of the classifier. The AUC value represents the area under the ROC curve, usually between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1, the better the classifier performance is, and the closer it is to 0.5, the worse the performance is (no different from random guessing).
ROC analysis is often used to compare the performance of different models, select the best classifier, optimize the model threshold, etc. It has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis, credit scoring, advertising click prediction and other fields.
