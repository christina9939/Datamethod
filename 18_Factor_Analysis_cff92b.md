# 11. Factor Analysis

Factor analysis is a statistical method used to analyze the potential structure or potential factors between observed variables. It aims to identify the commonalities between multiple observed variables, summarize them into a smaller number of potential factors, and explore the relationship between these factors and the original variables. Factor analysis is often used in data dimensionality reduction, variable screening, construction of scales or measurement tools, discovery of potential structures, etc.
In factor analysis, the following steps are mainly included:
• Extracting factors: Extracting potential common factors in the data through statistical methods. Commonly used extraction methods include principal component analysis (PCA), maximum likelihood estimation, minimum residual method, etc.
• Rotating factors: Rotating the extracted factors to make the factor structure easier to interpret. Common rotation methods include orthogonal rotation (such as Varimax rotation) and oblique rotation (such as Promax rotation).
• Factor interpretation: Explain the meaning of each factor and link them to the original variables to understand the underlying structure.
• Factor score calculation: Calculate the score of each observed sample on each factor based on the factor loading for further analysis.
Factor analysis is applicable to many fields, including psychology, education, market research, medical research, etc. It can be used to explore the potential relationship between variables, build latent variable models, simplify data structures, etc.
