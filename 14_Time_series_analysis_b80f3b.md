# 7. Time series analysis

Time series analysis is a statistical method for studying data that changes over time. A time series is a series of data points arranged in chronological order, usually observations collected at equal intervals. These data points can be used to analyze trends, periodicity, seasonality, and other possible patterns over time.
Time series analysis mainly includes the following aspects:
• Trend analysis: Identify and describe long-term trends in the data to determine whether the data is gradually increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.
• Seasonality analysis: Explore whether there are patterns in the data that repeat according to the season. Seasonality analysis helps to understand the cyclical fluctuations of data within a year.
• Cyclic analysis: Similar to seasonality, cyclical analysis focuses on long-term recurring patterns, but the cycle of these patterns may not be a fixed year.
• Noise analysis: Examine random fluctuations in time series to determine whether there are unpredictable random changes.
• Forecasting and model building: Based on existing time series data, mathematical models are established to predict future observations.
Time series analysis has applications in many fields, including finance, economics, meteorology, ecology, medicine, etc. By deeply understanding the patterns of time series, people can better predict future trends, make decisions, and plan.
