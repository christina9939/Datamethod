# 3. Hypothesis Testing and Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on obtaining information about the population from a sample. It helps us understand the nature of the population, make predictions, or infer population parameters by analyzing and inferring sample statistics.
Inferential statistics mainly includes two aspects:
1) Parameter estimation: using sample data to estimate the value of the population parameter, including point estimation and interval estimation. Point estimation gives a single value as an estimate of the population parameter, while interval estimation provides an interval of parameter estimation, indicating our uncertainty about the population parameter.
2) Hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing is a common method in statistics used to test a hypothesis about a population parameter. This method is based on sample data and evaluates whether the null hypothesis can be rejected by comparing the difference between the observed statistical value and the theoretical expected value under the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing usually includes the following steps:
• Establishing a hypothesis: Propose a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1) about the population parameter.
• Selecting a significance level: Determine the significance level (usually 0.05), indicating that at this level, if the observed difference is large enough, the null hypothesis is rejected.
• Collect sample data: Draw a sample from the population and calculate the sample statistic.
• Calculate the test statistic: Calculate a test statistic based on the sample data, the distribution of which is known under the condition that the null hypothesis is true.
• Make a decision: Compare the calculated test statistic with the significance level. If it is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, accept the null hypothesis.
