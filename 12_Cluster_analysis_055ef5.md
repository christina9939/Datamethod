# 5. Cluster analysis

Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning method that aims to divide observations in a data set into similar groups, which are called clusters. The goal of clustering is to make observations within the same cluster more similar, while observations between different clusters are less similar. Through clustering, we can discover the inherent structure in the data, identify patterns, and divide similar observations into the same group, which helps to deeply understand the data.
Cluster analysis is widely used in many fields, such as:
• Market analysis: Segment the market based on consumer behavior to better understand the target market.
• Biology: Cluster gene expression data into gene groups with similar functions.
• Image analysis: Cluster similar images together for image retrieval and classification.
• Social network analysis: Group users in a social network according to their behavior patterns.
